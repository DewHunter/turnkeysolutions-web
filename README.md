## Development

### Dev Setup
* Install bun: https://bun.sh/ then run `bun install` then `bun dev` to preview the website.

### Other Info
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### TODOs
* Fix Responsive typography so font scales with viewport
* Fix responsive everything to adapt to phone-sized screens (mainly typography, navbar and footer).
